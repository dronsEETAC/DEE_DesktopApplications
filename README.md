# Desktop applications
## 1. General description
The modules in this block are front-end desktop modules developed in Python and using Tkinter (or CustomTkinter) as GUI. Each of the module has a GitHub repo where you can find the code together with a description, installation instructions and demos. These are the repos:

* *Dashboard*:

* *Drone Circus*:
[![DroneEngineeringEcosystem Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DEE-DroneCircus-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/dronsEETAC/DroneCircusDEE) a desktop application that allows the user to interact with the drone platform in a fun way (for instance, guide the drone with body poses or with the voice). 


## Python and PyCharm
In order to run and contribute to the modules in this block you need to install versi√≥n 3.7 of Python. We recomend you to use PyCharm as IDE for development in Python.
